# MicroMacro (Working Title)

MicroMacro is an interactive work. **Click [here](https://ilginicozu.github.io/MicroMacro/)** to see the work.

### Instructions

As a work in progress, MicroMacro is 4000x4000 px. In order to see the full work you should zoom out your browser window (It will be changed to windowWidth/windowHeight).

Mouse X axis = Rotates the circle and the background.

Mouse Y axis = Zoom in or out.

Mouse Click; 

*to center* = Pick a **random** color (in the final version this will change to; Pick a color **in order**)

*to the left half of the circle* = Changes the circle's texture to **curved lines** with the choosen color.

*to the right half of the circle* = Changes the circle's texture to **straight lines** with the choosen color.

*to the left half of the background* = Changes the background's texture to **curved thick lines** with the choosen color.

*to the right half of the background* = Changes the background's texture to **straight lines** with the choosen color.
              
Each texture is generative in itself and I will add more possibilities.

About the cursor = Cursor shape changes to reflect the choosen textures in the indicated zone. When it is idle it will disappear.

**Find your sweetspot and enjoy!**

# Magnificum

Magnificum is an interactive work. **Click [here](https://ilginicozu.github.io/Magnificum/)** to see the work.

### Instructions

Mouse X axis = Rotates the circle and the background.

Mouse Y axis = Zoom in or out.

Mouse Click; 

*to center* = Pick a color **in order**

*to the left half of the circle* = Changes the circle's texture to **curved lines** with the choosen color.

*to the right half of the circle* = Changes the circle's texture to **straight lines** with the choosen color.

*to the left half of the background* = Changes the background's texture to **curved thick lines** with the choosen color.

*to the right half of the background* = Changes the background's texture to **straight lines** with the choosen color.
              
Each texture is generative in itself and I will add more possibilities.

About the cursor = Cursor shape changes to reflect the choosen textures in the indicated zone. When it is idle it will disappear.

**Find your sweetspot and enjoy!**
